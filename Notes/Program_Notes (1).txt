What is the programming style & paradigm for Go? 

Programming Paradigms : How does the programs deal with execution model [sequence of operations/steps; way the code is organized; grouping of the code units; state of the code of a language:

What can be the most common programming paradigm :

1. Imperative style of coding : 

- Procedural
- Object Oriented

programming language :

a. Paradigm
   a.1 Imperative
	a.1.1 Procedural
	a.1.2 OOP
   a.2 Declarative 
	a.2.1 Functional
	a.2.2 Reactive
	a.2.3 Logic cycles

Go :: What is the programming paradigm it uses : Multi-paradigm + Object Oriented + Concurrent Imperative

Go :

a. Supports multiple programming paradigm : Code is developed/organized + Execution Model works can vary depending upon the end goal to be achieved

C/C++/Java :: Hello World :: define the class,function,call a system function
Ruby/Python/Scala/Go : Multiple styles for writing the same Hello World program :

a. OOPs way
b. print "hello world"

C/C++ vs Java :: OOPs vs Functional || Introduce members in the class/functions :

--> Java/C++/C : Statically typed language :: Design/compile time
--> Ruby/Python/Perl/Scala : Dynamically typed language :: Design/compile + Run time 

Go :: Feature :: Static Language

Go :: Statically Typed Language ::

- Type Safety : Static Type Checking
- Minimal implementation of type safety checks
- Defined Data Types 

Imperative + Declarative

Go : OOPs
Go : Functional Style + Reactive 

What is the Go version : 

a. Latest : Go v1.18
b. Good support :: Backward Compatibility
c. Which is the Go version to work with?

Check : go version

- What are the OS that Go supports (& what are the best versions) :

a. *nix - FreeBSD, DragonBSD, NetBSD
b. MacOS
c. Windows 

- Thumbrule :: Go :: Staging env + Prod env :: *nix
- Dev env : Windows

Go : Open Source [63 types of licenses] : 3-clause BSD 

Why Go :

- Simplicity or Simplicity - Sugar Syntax [define/declare/design the code]
- How well the keywords are defined (Scala : acute complexities) : Go --> 27-28 keywords
- Go :: Picked the troubles of C/C++ + Python

C\C++ : Go --> better memory management (MM)
C/C++ (MM/member scope/lifecycle/allocs/dealloc) : MM has to be done manually || Go -- > Well defined GC

--> Memory
--> Flush
--> DOM/POM
--> .close()
--> .exit()

Poor MM --> Security Vulnerabilities 

Security Vulnerabilities :: CIA Triad

C - Confidentiality
I - Integrity
A - Availability

--> Go :: Compiled Language :: C/C++
--> Go :: Compiled like C/C++ BUT has similarities with Python

Go Packages : https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/F2wwCnzvAs3qmMZczb5J_?domain=pkg.go.dev

Go --> Hello World 

-> Notepad++
-> directory :: dump all the practice
-> cmd : run the code

Go code --> C

fmt - packages

Program :: members : classes/functions --> structure/reusability/external :: grouping of the functions/members

Style of writing :

- Syntax sugar : Inspiration from C
- Code concise + readable : Simplicity
- remote or the different package management :: Go code 
- Go compile
- Flexibility 
- Go : EOL is NOT compulsory
- EOL feature : ; [C/C++/Python/Common Sense] 
- Go is a case Sensitive Language : member names :: fmt vs Fmt
- Exported Members : Capital Case
- How to deal with Exception Handling :: Compiled language :: errors vs exception 

go run <file name> 


- "fmt" --> "FMT" :: works 
- What is the definition of the package FMT? :: Where to get the details of FMT package

Go :: Packages :

a. Core to the design principle of Go
b. Types : Go defined packages + custom defined packages
c. The packages are distributable

"fmt" - core packages in Go. I/O operations

--> Where can we see the list of CMD commands?
--> From Where is "go" getting invoked? 

go help

--> Go Docs
--> CMD : go help 

To execute a command/function from CMD : go <command>

go help --> display the list of commands & doc topics

go help <command> --> displays the details about the specific command/topics

go list :: display the list of packages or modules that we are using in our working directory

cmd --> go list --> Searching for a file called "go.mod" 

nodejs :: package.json :: project env :: Node version + packages + versions of the packages + dependencies

go mod init <module name> 

Go : go.mod file [module paths] :: At the root of my working/parent directory 

Initialize the app/project/codes :: go.mod

go list [list :: list the packages]

go.mod :: Reside --> a. Local Machine b. Main branch of my Github/SCM repo

- Can we multiple modules defined in the same go.mod file? If yes - how [syntax]; if No - how to define multiple modules

- How to modify/reload with changes for a go.mod file using the cmd

From Where is "go" getting invoked? : C:\Program Files\Go\bin

pkg --> packages :: available in a specific Go SDK version --> package definition from Go

API's --> Each version has it's packages defined --> Multiple methods/calls 

Analogy :

Amazon : Some common functions [payment gateway] + product catalogued/display [different]

-> Mobile app 
-> Mobile website
-> website
-> Gear app 

API's --> Each version has it's packages defined --> Multiple methods/calls  :: API-first Design

print :: I/O --> Go :: "fmt" package

go get <calling a package> :: parent directory :: if go.mod is available :: update go.mod :: Inherent intelligence of Go language

checksum algorithm :: Go - go.sum file - working on an authentication modules

SQL Injections/Dirty Injections/Cross-site scripts

https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/pP3tCoOwBuPLvxVCmNmen?domain=rsc.io : author of the program (implementing the quote functions) or the end users knows :: any challenges/issues ? 


Internal module :: Authenticating module :: part of Go SDK

Authenticating module :: part of Go SDK :: sum.go file :: Checksum algorithm

go mod init <module path> 

go mod tidy : new dependencies/package calls needed based on the changes in my directory, it will fetch the updates & publish the updates in go.mod file

Simple but effective tools with Go ecosystem :

Python :: Indentation 

Code reviews :

a. Use Go style of coding as much as possible
b. Write Go style and NOT C/C++ style

Lint/Linting Tools : Across all programming languages

a. Code follows the right guidelines/coding standards
b. How efficiently the members are utilized
c. Calls are made to external dependiences
d. Documented

Go --> Strict typing :: variable types

Strict typing :: C/C++ 

Go Flexibility :: Depending on the type of declaring the variables, types "may be" avoided :: Dynamic Programming Language [Python]

--> Data Types in Go : 3 basic types used in Go :

a. Numeric Type :

int8/16/32/64

uint8/16/32/64

float32/64

complex64/128

b. String Type - All the different operations :: Concatenation/extracting
c. Boolean Type - True or False

How do we define variables in Go :

var <variable_name> <type> 

var <variable_name> <type>  = value

var b int

// Single line comment

/* Multi line
comment line 1
comment line 2
